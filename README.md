# Multi-class semantic segmentation w/ Keras
Semantic segmentation for multiclass annotations using Keras/tf

If you want to read a brief description about how I got to make this model you can read [this post](https://medium.com/@mario.sb93/semantic-segmentation-for-dummies-30206769383e).

You can play around with this [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I6A7ChKDmApP2rA3f2yNsFn4wASgQZOL)

Libraries I used was:
  - **Tesorflow-GPU**
  - **Matplotlib**
  - **OpenCV**
  - **NumPy**
  - **Keras**

And project is tested over **Python 2.7**
